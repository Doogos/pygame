# pygame
<br />
I started learning pygame because I couldn't get tkinter to work the way I wanted it to. I spent too long trying to rewrite my original terminal game code work with tkinter, I never successfully displayed a window that had the areas and text I wanted. Pygame is built for games so I'm hoping to accomplish my goals for my text adventure game using this method. If not, there will be sadness.

<h4>Game 1 - Space Invader</h4>
Followed the guide posted by <b>FreeCodeCamp</b> on <b>Youtube</b>.<br />
I changed and added a couple of things to spice it up and learn more than what the video called for. I made a mistake and downloaded files that were too large, therefore I had to learn to resize the images within the code because I cannot be bothered to go back and download the correct size.<br />

<h4>Game 2 - Souls Adventure</h4>
I've always wanted to create a text based game. My goal is to create a text game that allows the user to click buttons to make a choice to proceed through the game.
As of 8/28/21, I am currently struggling with getting text to wrap so an entire paragraph can be displayed.
